  <h2>Band Info</h2>
    <p>Jagwar Ma is an Australian psychedelic/dance band formed in Sydney in 2011, consisting of members Gabriel Winterfield (lead vocalist/guitarist), Jono Ma (guitar, beats, synths, production), and bass guitarist Jack Freeman (joined 2012). The band name is derived from a satirical compound of the word "jaguar" and Jono’s surname.
      <br>
      <br> In 2013 Jagwar Ma signed with record labels Mom+Pop (US) Marathon Artists (EU) and Future Classic (Australia) and released their debut album "Howlin". Howlin’ received high acclaim from music press like The NME, Pitchfork and the London Times as well as praise from high profile artists like Noel Gallagher, Foals and The XX, who they went on to join on tour. Now based in the UK, Jagwar Ma are currently touring "Howlin" and have begun preparation for their second album.</p>

      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <br>
    <p>Ma and Winterfield met in 2007. At this time both were playing in different groups, Lost Valentinos and Ghostwood (band). It would not be until mid 2010 at an FLRL performance that the two shared the stage. FLRL was a locally based krautrock/experimental pop group - with the motto "a band without members,"-local musicians would get together, curate an evening of new music, and perform it to an audience. One night Winterfield took vocals/guitar and Ma generated sounds from the use of vintage drum machines, Radio Frequency manipulation, improvised percussion, and other esoteric methods of creating sound. Reactions varied, but the duo and other fellow musicians were not dismayed. By 2011, Ma and Winterfield began frequently getting together at a studio (often a living room) and recording sounds and melodies, whilst also swapping old demos from unfinished side projects, "Jaguar Paw" and "Flintstone". Both Ma and Winterfield cites themselves as 'voracious collectors of music of the 20th Century,'. Subsequently, loose jams and recordings started as anything from Motown to Electronica. It would be during these recording sessions that the bands first songs "Come Save Me" and "What Love" would emerge. At this point the pair decided to semi relocate to France and to extend what was originally "going to be a one off 7 inch single" to a full LP. Jack Freeman, a London based musician and old friend joined the live lineup mid 2012.</p>
