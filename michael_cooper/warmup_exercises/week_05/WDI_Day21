CRUD Review:
------------
- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
- The purpose of a CRUD application gives you the ability to interact with a database without having to write SQL or other queries.
- A CRUD application allows a database to be made without needing to know all the data to start with.
- CRUD Table:

+------------+----------+------------------+--------+---------------+
| Activities |  Verbs   |       URLs       |  SQL   |    Action     |
+------------+----------+------------------+--------+---------------+
| Create     | POST     | /butterflies     | INSERT | #create/#new  |
| Read       | GET      | /butterflies     | SELECT | #index        |
| Read2      | GET      | /butterflies/:id | SELECT | #show         |
| Update     | POST     | /butterflies/:id | UPDATE | #update/#edit |
| Delete     | (DELETE) | /butterflies/:id |        | #delete       |

Why SQL Sucks:
--------------
- Because SQL queries are written within a ruby file, there are a lot of weaknesses, such as not being able to interpolate a single quote '.
- Worse than this, any place a user can interpolate SQL, a user can get way too much access to a database.
- SQL Injection attacks are commonplace for causing mayhem within a private database. This can do things like delete an entire database table or get access to private user information.
- These weaknesses are the basis behind Acitve Record, so that these kinds of problems can't occur.

Active Record:
--------------
- Allows you to access database records and import the data as a related class to make the database object as a simple programming object.
- An ActiveRecord object can be created by writing:
  [3] pry(main)> ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  [3] pry(main)*   :adapter => 'sqlite3',
  [3] pry(main)*   :database => 'database.db'
  [3] pry(main)* )
- You need to name your ruby class the same name as the database table. The class name should be singular and the table should be lowercase plural. E.g.
  - Class: butterfly
  - Table: butterflies
  - in Ruby it would be written as: 
    [4] pry(main)> class Butterfly < ActiveRecord::Base
    [4] pry(main)* end
  - Once the class has been imported, all the getters and setters are automatically set and it will ignore the required properties (e.g. an autoincrementing ID number)
- Once the class has been made for the table, you can very easily get access to the properties with:
  - butterfly = Butterfly.find params[:id]
  - butterfly.property
- It is better to have things work by following convention rather than having to configure things.
