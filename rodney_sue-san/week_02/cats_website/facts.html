        <h1>Cat facts...</h1>
      

        <ol>
          <li>Every year, nearly four million cats are eaten in Asia</li>
          <li>On average, cats spend 2/3 of every day sleeping. That means a nine-year-old cat has been awake for only three years of its life</li>
          <li>When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down</li>
          <li>A cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down</li>
          <li>Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10</li>
          <li>There are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world, with approximately 40 recognized breeds</li>
          <li>Approximately 24 cat skins can make a coat</li>
          <li>During the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Pope Innocent VIII condemned cats as evil and thousands of cats were burned. Unfortunately, the widespread killing of cats led to an explosion of the rat population, which exacerbated the effects of the Black Death</li>
          <li>The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a. “Astrocat”) In 1963, France blasted the cat into outer space. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip</li>
          <li>A cat’s hearing is better than a dog’s. And a cat can hear high-frequency sounds up to two octaves higher than a human</li>
          <li>A cat can travel at a top speed of approximately 31 mph (49 km) over a short distance</li>
          <li>A cat can jump up to five times its own height in a single bound</li>
          <li>Smuggling a cat out of ancient Egypt was punishable by death. Phoenician traders eventually succeeded in smuggling felines, which they sold to rich people in Athens and other important cities</li>
        </ol>
