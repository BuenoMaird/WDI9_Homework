Variables

Data types
 - strings
 - number
 - boolean

functions = methods
 -implicit return (don't need to type return)

if/unless

loops
 - while
 - for
 - each = a better to loop through things while in ruby. This doesnt work for javascript :(

Arrays
 - listing things
Hashes
 - Can hold key/value pairs. 
 - Kind of like a dictionary

---OOP--

.invert will reverse the key/value pairs so you can search for a value..

classes
 - Sort of like factories
 - Can set different attributes for each object within the class
 - INSTANCE VARIABLES = @
 - Initialize will automatically setup information to be applied to a class
 - ATTR_ACCESSOR will setup methods required to add things to a class
