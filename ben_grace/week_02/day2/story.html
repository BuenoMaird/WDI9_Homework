        <h3>Album 1: The bitter end..</h3>
        <p>The trilogy kicks off with the protagonist taking off to sea after finding his brother in bed with his wife. The album explores his emotions as he sets out to sea dealing with his sense of betrayal and anger.
        <br>
        <br>
        While at sea the sailor finds a mentor in his "Great Captain" who attempts to take him under his wing as a sailor to soothe the trouble man. The Captain succeeds for a time but the hate is still underneath the surfce.
        <br>
        <br>
        The album ends with the captain having died in a fire while trying to save his own family. The sailor takes his place at the head of the ship and sails for home docking finally in port after 3 years.

        <h3>Album 2: The eventually home..</h3>
        <p>The second album picks up with our protagonist having developed an opiate addicition, slowly losing his mind to the drug and his hatred for his wife as he regrets running instead of taking action initially.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the conclusion of the second album we find the former captain standing over his wife, ready to finally get the revenge he feels he deserves. This scene leads directly into the third album

        <h3>Album 3: The church and the good thief..</h3>
        <p>In the third album we pick up exactly where the second finished. The former captain is standing over his wife, poised to murder when suddenly he changes his mind and kills his brother instead. The rest of the album plays out in his jail cell as he comes to terms with deed that he has done.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the final songs he comes to terms with his death and seeks forgiveness for all that he has done. I could go into this more, if anyone is interested but I'd be surprised if anyone has read this far. I'm tired. I'm going to have a glass of milk and go to bed. Night. xoxo</p>
