	<h3>Ta-ku</h3>

	<p>Within just 4 years of operation in his chosen field, Regan ‘Ta-ku’ Mathews, from Perth, Australia has evolved from a self-taught student of music into a scholar of progressive beat production, cultivating a unique sound that has since resonated to all corners of the globe. As an astute observer of the melodic elements of soul music and the percussive elements of hip-hop, Ta-Ku takes influence from pioneering beatsmiths such as J Dilla, 9th Wonder, and DJ Premier. </p>
